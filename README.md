# STAT 720 - Design of Experiments  
Summer 2025   
Kansas State University

**Instructor:** Dr. Josefina Lacasa  

**Time:** Mon-Tue-Wed-Thu-Fri 9:10 am - 10.10 am   

**Course Description:**  This course introduces students to the design and analysis of experiments.
The statistical modeling in this course will focus on statistical thinking (more on statistical thinking [here](https://errorstatistics.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brown-and-kass_what-is-statistics-with-discussion.pdf)). 
We will cover basics of designed experiments, basic experiment designs (e.g., completely randomized designs, randomized complete block designs, incomplete block designs, split-plot designs) and may cover more advanced topics like power analyses.
Note that more complex designs and data structure may be covered in Analysis of Messy Data (STAT 870). 

**Main Goal of this Course:**  
The main goal of this course is to present the basic concepts of designed experiments. 
Students are expected to learn to identify key design components, write out the corresponding statistical model and fit it to the data using R software.  

**What this course is not:** an R programming course (however, help will be provided).

**Prerequisites:** STAT 705.
