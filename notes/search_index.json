Broadly, projects are expected to identify a research problem and develop a designed experiment that is appropriate for solving that problem. Projects consist of a manuscript and a tutorial that describes the research problem, the experiment design and the treatment design. 4.1 Learning objectives Be able to identify a experiment design that is appropriate for answering a given research question and reflect on strengths and weaknesses. Be able to write out a statistical model that is appropriate for that design. 4.2 Partial deadlines 4.2.1 Project proposal - Due Friday June 13 at 2pm CT Write a page-long project proposal that states your research problem and the objective of your project. An example of an appropriate project proposal can be found here. 4.2.2 Written report - Due Friday July 25 at 2pm CT Submit a manuscript including an Introduction, Methods (including a clear and complete description of the statistical model), Expected results, and Discussions. 4.2.3 Practical reads Casler, M.D. (2015), Fundamentals of Experimental Design: Guidelines for Designing Successful Experiments.
