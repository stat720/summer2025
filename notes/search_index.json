Grades: A (100-89.999999999(!!!)), B (89.99-79.99), C (79.99-69.99), D (69.99-59.99), F (&lt;59.99). 1.2 Learning goals By the end of this course, you should be able to: - Be able to identify the treatment design and experiment design (and other components of the design). - Be able to write out the statistical model. - Know the benefits/disadvantages of different experiment designs. 1.3 Notes on notation scalars: \\(y\\), \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\beta_0\\) vectors: \\(\\mathbf{y} \\equiv [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]&#39;\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\equiv [\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_p]&#39;\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\) matrices: \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), \\(\\Sigma\\) probability distribution: \\(\\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\boldsymbol{0}, \\sigma^2\\mathbf{I})\\) 1.4 Why do designed experiments exist? 1.4.1 Example Your friend Susie is planting tomatos in her backyard. She bought three different varieties and wishes to know which one she likes the best, to buy more next year. The traits Susie values the most are yield (in kg week-1) and size (in g tomato-1). Which scenario do you think is more appropriate? Case A: Susie buys 3 plants of each variety. She divides her orchard into three sectors and plants each variety in a different sector. Case B: Susie buys 1 plant of each variety. She divides her orchard into three sectors and plants each variety in a different sector. Case C: Susie buys 3 plants of each variety. She randomly assigns what variety goes into which hole. 1.5 The golden rules of designed experiments Randomization Replication Local control "],["what-are-designed-experiments.html", "Day 2 What are designed experiments? 2.1 Some examples 2.2 What do they all have in common?", " Day 2 What are designed experiments?

Broadly, projects are expected to identify a research problem and develop a designed experiment that is appropriate for solving that problem. Projects consist of a manuscript and a tutorial that describes the research problem, the experiment design and the treatment design. 4.1 Learning objectives Be able to identify a experiment design that is appropriate for answering a given research question and reflect on strengths and weaknesses. Be able to write out a statistical model that is appropriate for that design. 4.2 Partial deadlines 4.2.1 Project proposal - Due Friday June 13 at 2pm CT Write a page-long project proposal that states your research problem and the objective of your project. An example of an appropriate project proposal can be found here. 4.2.2 Written report - Due Friday July 25 at 2pm CT Submit a manuscript including an Introduction, Methods (including a clear and complete description of the statistical model), Expected results, and Discussions. 4.2.3 Practical reads Casler, M.D. (2015), Fundamentals of Experimental Design: Guidelines for Designing Successful Experiments.
