Case B: - On Monday: Bake 3 cookies, each with a different levels of baking powder:baking soda ratio. - On Tuesday: Bake 3 cookies, each with a different levels of baking powder:baking soda ratio. - On Wednesday: Bake 3 cookies, each with a different levels of baking powder:baking soda ratio. Case C: - On Monday: Bake 3 cookies with the first level of baking powder:baking soda ratio. - On Tuesday: Bake 3 cookies with the second level of baking powder:baking soda ratio. - On Wednesday: Bake 3 cookies with the third level of baking powder:baking soda ratio.

The golden rules of designed experiments: Randomization Replication Local control (blocking) Experimental unit: smallest unit to which a treatment is independently assigned/applied. Observational unit: smallest unit on which observations are made. 2.1 Types of designs - the basics There are several ways to carry out an experiment. The way we carry out an experiment is important because it will establish the blueprint for how the data are generated. This means that the design will determine what observations are similar to each other. Figure 2.1: A blueprint is to a building what the experimental design is to the data. Source 2.1.1 Completely randomized design (CRD) Blueprint: all experimental units are similar. The only factor driving differences between observations is the treatment (and randomness). \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). Figure 2.2: Schematic description of an experiment with a completely randomized design 2.1.2 Randomized complete block design (RCBD) Blocks are groups of similar experimental units and are large enough to fit each treatment at least once Blueprint: all experimental from the same block are similar to each other. The factors driving differences between observations are the treatment and the blocks (and randomness). \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\rho_j + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\rho_j\\) is the effect of the \\(j\\)th block, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). Figure 2.3: Schematic description of an experiment with a randomized complete block design 2.1.3 Incomplete block design (IBD) Blocks are groups of similar experimental units and are not large enough to fit each treatment at least once Blueprint: all experimental from the same block are similar to each other. The factors driving differences between observations are the treatment and the blocks (and randomness). We will define the model for this design later on.

What does “ANOVA” mean? 3.3.1 The most common assumptions behind most software Constant variance Independence Normality We can describe the general linear model as \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the treatment effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). The form used to describe the model above is called “Model equation form”. Another way of saying the same is the “Probability distribution form”, where we describe the distribution of \\(y\\) directly. \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma^2). \\end{equation}\\] "],["linear-models-applied-to-the-basic-types-of-designed-experiments.html", "Day 4 Linear models applied to the basic types of designed experiments 4.1 Review 4.2 Experiment designs and their models", " Day 4 Linear models applied to the basic types of designed experiments June 12th, 2025 4.1 Review Experimental unit The golden rules of designed experiments: Replication Randomization Local control (blocking) Types of designs 4.2 Experiment designs and their models 4.2.1 Completely randomized design (CRD) Blueprint: all experimental units were Figure 4.1: Schematic description of an experiment with a completely randomized design "],["review-organizing-data-and-other-helpful-tips.html", "Day 5 Review, organizing data and other helpful tips 5.1 Review 5.2 Organizing data 5.3 Other helpful tips", " Day 5 Review, organizing data and other helpful tips June 13th, 2025 5.1 Review Experimental unit The golden rules of designed experiments: Replication Randomization Local control (blocking) Experiment designs and their models 5.2 Organizing data Data Organization in Spreadsheets 5.3 Other helpful tips "],["the-treatment-structure.html", "Day 6 The treatment structure 6.1 Review 6.2 Design structure versus treatment structure", " Day 6 The treatment structure June 16th, 2025 6.1 Review 6.2 Design structure versus treatment structure Treatments or treatment combinations or factors and factor combinations that the experimenter wishes to study.
