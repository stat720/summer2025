The golden rules of designed experiments: Randomization Replication Local control (blocking) Experimental unit: smallest unit to which a treatment is independently assigned/applied. Observational unit: smallest unit on which observations are made. 2.3 Types of designs - the basics There are several ways to carry out an experiment. The way we carry out an experiment is important because it will establish the blueprint for how the data are generated. This means that the design will determine what observations are similar to each other. Figure 2.1: A blueprint is to a building what the experimental design is to the data. Source 2.3.1 Completely randomized design (CRD) Blueprint: all experimental units are similar. The only factor driving differences between observations is the treatment (and randomness). \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). Figure 2.2: Schematic description of an experiment with a completely randomized design 2.3.2 Randomized complete block design (RCBD) Blocks are groups of similar experimental units and are large enough to fit each treatment at least once Blueprint: all experimental from the same block are similar to each other. The factors driving differences between observations are the treatment and the blocks (and randomness). \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ijk} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\rho_j + \\varepsilon_{ijk}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ijk} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\rho_j\\) is the effect of the \\(j\\)th block, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). Figure 2.3: Schematic description of an experiment with a randomized complete block design 2.3.3 Incomplete block design (IBD) Blocks are groups of similar experimental units and are not large enough to fit each treatment at least once Blueprint: all experimental from the same block are similar to each other. The factors driving differences between observations are the treatment and the blocks (and randomness). We will define the model for this design later on, after learning more about mixed models. Figure 2.4: Schematic description of an experiment with an incomplete block design 2.4 Skeleton ANOVA tables The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) can be considered a special case of a linear model that divides the predictors in bins to evaluate their influence on the response (Gelman 2005).

The golden rules to design experiments: Replication Randomization Local control (blocking) A good set of steps to analyze data that is handed to us: What are the treatment factors? What is the experimental unit? Is it the same as the observational unit? How were the treatments applied? (What is the blueprint of the design/underlying structure?) Building the statistical model: Deterministic component Random component (probability distribution) Estimation Method 4.2 Linear models 4.2.1 The most common model - Assumptions Common assumptions behind the default in most software: Constant variance Independence this is what is affected by the design! Normality We can describe the general linear model as \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the treatment effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). 4.2.2 Connection between this and your classical ANOVA table Recall that under Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and assuming a normal distribution, the estimates for MLE and Least Squares Estimation (LSE) are equivalent: \\(\\hat\\beta_{MLE} =\\hat\\beta_{LSE}\\). Least Squares means that the estimates (\\(\\hat\\beta\\)) are the ones that minimize \\(\\sum_{i=1}^ny_i-\\bar{y}\\). The SS can be divided into the ones explained by the model and the ones not explained by the model \\(SS_{total} = SS_{model} + SS_{error}\\). The SS can also be expressed dividing it into batches depending of their source of variability. The different SS are then used to get an \\(F\\) value used in the analysis of variance. The SS can also be used to estimate \\(\\sigma^2\\): \\(\\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i-\\hat{y_i})^2}{df_e}=\\frac{SS_{error}}{df_e}\\) \\(\\sigma^2 = \\frac{SSR}{df_e}\\) How does \\(\\sigma^2\\) affect inference? Confidence intervals: \\(CI_{95\\%} = \\hat{\\beta_j}\\pm t_{dfe, 1-\\alpha} \\cdot \\widehat{s.e.}(\\hat\\beta_j)\\) \\(\\widehat{s.e.}(\\hat\\beta_j) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\widehat{\\sigma^2}}{s^2_x (n-1)}}\\) 4.2.3 Sorghum example The data below were generated by an experiment comparing sorghum genotypes (Omer et al., 2015). The data presented here correspond to a randomized complete block design ( design structure) that was performed to study different genotypes. Remember that blocks are assumed to be aproximately homogeneous within. Back to the code we worked on yesterday.

Figure 6.5: Schematic description of an experiment with a two-way treatment structure with two controls Examples on the whiteboard 6.4 Where is the treatment structure connected to the statistical model? Remember: the general advice is to divide the sources of variation into treatment and design (i.e., topographical). Normally, the treatments affect the expected value and the experiment design has created groups of data that were generated together. Those groups are groups of similar data and that’s why we say that they are correlated. For now, we’ll leave said correlation in the residual variance-covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\).

In designed experiments, we often use the estimated marginal means or least square means to provide a more interpretable result. Estimated marginal means are the expected mean for a given level of a factor, averaging over the other factors in the model. In R, the estimated marginal means are famously handled with the emmeans package. 7.4.1 Example: Download the R script to follow along!

Random variables are usually described with their properties like the expected value and variance. The expected value and variance are the first and second central moments of a distribution, respectively. Regardless of the distribution of a random variable \\(y\\), we could calculate its expected value \\(E(y)\\) and variance \\(Var(y)\\). The expected value measures the average outcome of \\(y\\). The variance measures the dispersion of \\(y\\), i.e. how far the possible outcomes are spread out from their average. 10.2.1.1 Demo: normally distributed random variable 10.2.1.2 Review: variance-covariance The variance of a random variable can be conceived as the level of dispersion in a variable. The covariance between two random variables means how the two random variables behave relative to each other. Essentially, it quantifies the relationship between their joint variability. For example, the covariance between two variables \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) will make Note that the variance of a random variable is the covariance of a random variable with itself. Consider two variables \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\) each with a variance of 1 and a covariance of 0.6. Using the notation we’ve been using in class, that can be written as \\[\\mathbf{y} \\sim N (\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\mathbf{V}),\\] where \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the vector containing the variables \\(y_1\\) and \\(y_2\\), \\(\\mathbf{y} \\equiv [y_1, y_2]&#39;\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}\\) is the mean vector, \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu} \\equiv [0,0]&#39;\\), and \\(\\mathbf{V}\\) is the variance-covariance matrix. We can say that \\(\\mathbf{V} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0.6 \\\\ 0.6 &amp; 1\\end{bmatrix}\\). set.seed(43) # some covariance mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, .6, .6, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] -0.03751376 -1.28219179 mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, .6, .6, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] -0.48596752 0.08056847 mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, .6, .6, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] -0.9040981 -0.7644051 mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, .6, .6, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] 0.3864344 0.1835374 # no covariance mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] -0.6861798 -1.9061368 mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] 1.8037598 -0.9668729 mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] -0.3531183 1.1069375 mgcv::rmvn(1, c(0,0), matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow=2, ncol=2)) ## [1] 0.5663244 2.0643087 10.3 Review: Designs When we model data generated by designed experiments, we typically put the information from the treatment as affecting the mean (\\(\\mu\\)), while the elements from the design (topographical, design, or the logistics of the experiment) indicate which observations are independent and which ones are not.

If you don’t manage your oven temperature and amount of bananas properly, you might end up with a dough that is too heavy, does not rise properly, and ends up like the picture below. We’ll start with our go-to banana recipe and fine-tune the best baking temperature to get fluffy muffins. Check out the recipe here. Banana bread goes wrong 15.1.1 Baseline recipe for banana muffins: Dry ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (7 1/2 ounces) 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2/3 cup finely chopped pecans, toasted Wet ingredients: 1/2 cup light brown sugar (3 3/4 ounces) 1/4 cup granulated sugar (2 ounces) 2 large eggs 1 stick unsalted butter, browned and cooled (4 ounces) 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas, from very ripe bananas that have been peeled and mashed well with a fork (12 3/4 ounces) 2 tablespoons full-fat sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 15.2 Study / Research question What is the best temperature to bake the muffins? Let’s assume that we prefer higher muffins: what temperature will produce higher muffins? 250 °F 400 °F 550 °F 15.2.1 Proposed design experiment: RCBD Assuming we spread out all the work into multiple days, we can assume cooking day as the block. Then, the model to describe variations in the muffin height can be written as \\[y_{ik} = \\mu + b_k + T_i + \\varepsilon_{ik},\\] \\[b_k \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b^2), \\\\ \\varepsilon_{ik} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^2),\\] where \\(y_{ik}\\) is the observed height for the muffin baked under the \\(i\\)th treatment on day \\(k\\), \\(\\mu\\) is the overall muffin height, \\(T_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th temperature on muffin height, \\(b_k\\) is the day (block) effect, that arises from a normal distribution with variance \\(\\sigma^2_b\\), and \\(\\varepsilon_{ik}\\) is the residual for the muffin baked under the \\(i\\)th treatment on day \\(k\\). The final ANOVA table for this RCBD design is: Table 15.1: Treatment ANOVA for a one-way treatment structure in an RCBD Source df Day b-1 = 3-1 = 2 Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 Error(oven) (t-1)b - (t-1) = 2*3 - 2 = 4 Total N-1 = 8 15.2.2 Treatment means and confidence intervals The treatment mean for the \\(i\\)th temperature is \\(\\mu_i = \\mu + T_i\\). That mean won’t change under different design structures. What might change is the confidence interval around that mean. [For more information, see Chapter 24 in Milliken and Johnson’s Analysis of Messy Data]. First, recall the formula for a CI: \\(\\theta \\pm t_{df, \\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\cdot se(\\hat{\\theta})\\) #get test t qt(p = .975, df = 4) # df are df error(oven) ## [1] 2.776445 # standard error sqrt((2*sigma(m)^2) / 3) For example, the CI for the differences between means at 400F - 300F \\(\\mu_{400} - \\mu_{300}\\) is \\((\\widehat{\\mu_{400} - \\mu_{300}}) \\pm 2.78 \\cdot se(\\widehat{\\mu_{400} - \\mu_{300}})\\) \\(se(\\widehat{\\mu_{400} - \\mu_{300}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}}{r}}\\) \\[\\mu_i \\pm 2.78 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}}{r}}\\] 15.3 Tomorrow: What if we want to include more bananas in the recipe?

That mean won’t change under different design structures. What may change is the confidence interval around the mean difference.

Include ANOVA, stat model, mock R code, discussion of strengths and weaknesses of the experiment design. 18.2 Review of our experiment Research question: can we include more banana than the original recipe? Will the optimum temperature change depending on that recipe? Treatment structure: 3 \\(\\times\\) 2 factorial, with 3 levels for temperature (250, 400, 500) and 2 levels for recipe (Control, Extra Banana) Design structure: split-plot in an CRD, with temperature in the whole plot. Figure 18.1: Muffin experiment With that treatment structure, the statistical model will always begin with \\(y_{ijk} = \\mu + T_i + R_j +(TR)_{ij}\\), followed by the random effects. The random effects will depend on the design structure. 18.3 ANOVA tables 18.3.1 Split-plot in a CRD Table 18.1: ANOVA without subsampling Table 18.1: Design or Topographical Sources of Variability Source df - Error(oven) t*r-1 = 9-1 = 8 - - Error(oven) (b-1)* t * r = (2-1) * 3 * 3 = 9 Total N-1 = 17 Table 18.1: Treatment Sources of Variability Source df Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 - Banana b-1 = 2-1 = 1 TxB (t-1)*(b-1) = 2 Parallels N-tb = 18 - (3*2) = 12 Total N-1 = 17 Table 18.1: Combined Table of the Sources of Variability Source df Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 Error(oven) t*r-1 - (t-1)= 8 - 2 = 6 Banana b-1 = 2-1 = 1 TxB (t-1)*(b-1) = 2 Error(oven x day) (b-1)* t * r - (b-1) - (t-1)*(b-1) = 9 - 1 -2 = 6 Total N-1 = 17 18.3.2 Other possible designs 18.3.2.1 Split-plot in an RCBD Table 18.2: ANOVA without subsampling Table 18.2: Design or Topographical Sources of Variability Source df Day (block) r-1 = 3-1 = 2 - Error(oven) (t-1)r = (3-1)3 = 6 - - Error(oven x day) (b-1)* t * r = (2-1) * 3 * 3 = 9 Total N-1 = 17 Table 18.2: Treatment Sources of Variability Source df - Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 - Banana b-1 = 2-1 = 1 TxB (t-1)*(b-1) = 2 Parallels N-tb = 18 - (3*2) = 12 Total N-1 = 17 Table 18.2: Combined Table of the Sources of Variability Source df Day r-1 = 3-1 = 2 Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 Error(oven) (t-1)*r - (t-1)= 6 -2 = 4 Banana b-1 = 2-1 = 1 TxB (t-1)*(b-1) = 2 Error(oven x day) (b-1)* t * r - (b-1) - (t-1)*(b-1) = 9 - 1 -2 = 6 Total N-1 = 17 18.3.2.2 RCBD Table 18.3: ANOVA with subsampling Table 18.3: Design or Topographical Sources of Variability Source df Day (block) r-1 = 3-1 = 2 - Error(oven) (t-1)r = (3-1)3 = 6 - - Error(oven x day) (b-1)* t * r = (2-1) * 3 * 3 = 9 Error(recipe x oven x day) (m-1) * b * t * r = (3-1) * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36 Total N-1 = 53 Table 18.3: Treatment Sources of Variability Source df - Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 - Banana b-1 = 2-1 = 1 TxB (t-1)*(b-1) = 2 - Parallels N-tb = 54 - (3*2) = 48 Total N-1 = 17 Table 18.3: Combined Table of the Sources of Variability Source df Day r-1 = 3-1 = 2 Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 Error(oven) (t-1)*r - (t-1)= 6 -2 = 4 Banana b-1 = 2-1 = 1 TxB (t-1)*(b-1) = 2 Error(oven x day) (b-1)* t * r - (b-1) - (t-1)*(b-1) = 9 - 1 -2 = 6 Error(recipe x oven x day) (m-1) * b * t * r - 0 = 36 Total N-1 = 53 18.4 Applied analysis in R Get code from Thursday here.
