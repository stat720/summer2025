## Background  

Banana muffins, much like banana bread, present a unique baking challenge due to the inclusion of mashed bananas in the batter. While this ingredient contributes moisture and flavor, it can also result in a dense crumb if not balanced properly with other recipe components and baking conditions. In particular, oven temperature and banana quantity play a critical role in achieving a light, fluffy texture. This study begins with a standard banana muffin recipe and explores how adjusting the baking temperature affects the final crumb structure, with the goal of identifying optimal conditions for producing well-risen, tender muffins.

The objective of this study is to find the best combination of oven temperature and banana quantity to bake muffins.
