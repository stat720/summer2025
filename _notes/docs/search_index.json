What does “ANOVA” mean? \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}; \\ \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} y_{i} = \\beta_0 + \\x_{1i}\\beta_1 +\\x_{2i}\\beta_2 + \\x_{3i}\\beta_3 + \\varepsilon_{i}; \\ \\varepsilon_{i} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\\\ \\x_{1i} = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; \\text{if treatment A}\\\\ 0, &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] 3.4.1 The most common assumptions behind most software Constant variance Independence Normality We can describe the general linear model as \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the treatment effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). The form used to describe the model above is called “Model equation form”. Another way of saying the same is the “Probability distribution form”, where we describe the distribution of \\(y\\) directly. \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma^2). \\end{equation}\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
