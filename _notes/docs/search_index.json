Understanding the study Let someone else replicate your results Peer review Attendance today: fill out this form. 14.2 Fungicide x barley genotypes review Grown in 1995-1996 at the Scottish Crop Research Institute. 4 blocks, 2 fungicide treatments, and 70 barley varieties. Total area was 10 rows (north/south) by 56 beds (east/west). 14.3 Some examples Figure 14.1: M&amp;M example 1 - Study objective: To evaluate the effects of second iron injection and dietary iron levels on growth performance, hematological parameters, serum and liver mineral content, fecal score, short-chain fatty acids, and the microbiome of pigs. Figure 14.2: M&amp;M example 2 - Study objective: To understand of stress effects (e.g., water or nitrogen deficit) on senescence of field-grown plants. Figure 14.3: M&amp;M example 3 - Study objective: To describe the vertical distribution of soybean aphid within a soybean plant over time and to define optimal sample units of varying sizes 14.4 Review: Treatment Structure, Design structure. Why are they important? 14.4.1 Treatment Structure Defines the treatment mean Deterministic part of the model 14.4.2 Design Structure Defines the dependence patterns in the data Stochastic (random) part of the model 14.5 Monday Kahoot!
