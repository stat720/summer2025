Check out the original recipe here. Dry ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (7 1/2 ounces) 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 2/3 cup finely chopped pecans, toasted Wet ingredients: 1/2 cup light brown sugar (3 3/4 ounces) 1/4 cup granulated sugar (2 ounces) 2 large eggs 1 stick unsalted butter, browned and cooled (4 ounces) 1 1/2 cups mashed bananas, from very ripe bananas that have been peeled and mashed well with a fork (12 3/4 ounces or 361 gr.) 2 tablespoons full-fat sour cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 16.1.1 Research question What is the best temperature to bake the muffins? - 300 °F - 400 °F - 500 °F How much banana? - 1 1/2 cups (12.75 oz, or 361 gr.) - 2 cups (17 oz, or 482 gr.) 16.1.2 Proposed design experiment: RCBD Cooking day as blocks Oven as mini-blocks for banana quantity \\[y_{ik} = \\mu + T_i + b_k + \\varepsilon_{ik}\\] \\[b_k \\sim N(0, \\sigma_b^2) \\\\ \\varepsilon_{ik} \\sim N(0, \\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^2)\\] ANOVA table for this split-plot design Table 16.1: Treatment ANOVA for a two-way treatment structure in a split-plot Source df Day (block) r-1 = 3-1 = 2 Temperature t-1 = 3-1 = 2 Wholeplot|Error(oven)|Oven(Day) (t-1)r - (t-1) = 2*3 - 2 = 4 Banana b-1 = 2-1 = 1 Temp x Banana (t-1) (b-1) = 2*1 = 2 Error | Loaf(Oven x Day) (b-1)tr - (b-1) - (t-1) (b-1)= (1 * 3 * 3) - 1 - 2 = 6 Total N-1 = 17 16.1.3 Treatment means and confidence intervals The treatment mean for the \\(i\\)th temperature is \\(\\mu_i = \\mu + T_i + B_j +(TB)_{ij}\\). That mean won’t change under different design structures. What might change is the confidence interval around that mean. First, recall the formula for a CI: \\(\\theta \\pm t_{df, \\frac{\\alpha}{2}} \\cdot se(\\hat{\\theta})\\) For example, the CI for the differences between means for normal and high banana \\(\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}\\) is \\((\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}) \\pm 1.96 \\cdot se(\\widehat{\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}})\\) \\(se(\\widehat{\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}}{t \\cdot r}}\\) For example, the CI for the differences between means for 300F and 400F \\(\\mu_{1 \\cdot} - \\mu_{2 \\cdot}\\) is \\((\\mu_{1 \\cdot} - \\mu_{2 \\cdot}) \\pm 1.96 \\cdot se(\\widehat{\\mu_{1 \\cdot} - \\mu_{2 \\cdot}})\\) \\(se(\\widehat{\\mu_{1 \\cdot} - \\mu_{2 \\cdot}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (\\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon} + b \\cdot \\sigma^2_w)}{b \\cdot r}}\\) \\[\\mu_i \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2 (\\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon} + b \\cdot \\sigma^2_w)}{b \\cdot r}}\\] The CI for the differences between means for normal and high banana \\(\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}\\) is \\((\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}) \\pm 1.96 \\cdot se(\\widehat{\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}})\\) \\(se(\\widehat{\\mu_{\\cdot 1} - \\mu_{\\cdot 2}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}}{t \\cdot r}}\\) \\[\\mu_i \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\sigma^2_{\\varepsilon}}{r}}\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
