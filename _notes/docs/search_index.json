The golden rules to design experiments: Replication Randomization Local control (blocking) A good set of steps to analyze data that is handed to us: What are the treatment factors? What is the experimental unit? Is it the same as the observational unit? How were the treatments applied? (What is the blueprint of the design/underlying structure?) 4.2 Linear models 4.2.1 The most common model - Assumptions Common assumptions behind the default in most software: Constant variance Independence this is what is affected by the design! Normality We can describe the general linear model as \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the treatment effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). 4.2.2 Sorghum example The data below were generated by an experiment comparing sorghum genotypes (Omer et al., 2015). The data presented here correspond to a randomized complete block design ( design structure) that was performed to study different genotypes. Remember that blocks are assumed to be aproximately homogeneous within. Back to the code we worked on yesterday. 4.3 Takehomes 4.3.1 If you don’t include the design elements (blocks), their portion of the variance goes to the error library(tidyverse) library(emmeans) library(agridat) library(multcomp) # load data data(&quot;omer.sorghum&quot;) df &lt;- omer.sorghum %&gt;% filter(env == &quot;E3&quot;) # find out how many levels for trt factor &quot;genotype&quot; n_distinct(df$gen) ## [1] 18 # find out how many blocks n_distinct(df$rep) ## [1] 4 # fit linear model options(contrasts = c(&quot;contr.sum&quot;, &quot;contr.poly&quot;)) m_without &lt;- lm(yield ~ gen , data= df) m_with &lt;- lm(yield ~ gen + rep, data= df) m_without$df.residual ## [1] 54 summary(m_without)$sigma ## [1] 168.9182 m_with$df.residual ## [1] 51 summary(m_with)$sigma ## [1] 160.0855 means_with &lt;- emmeans(m_without, ~ gen) means_without &lt;- emmeans(m_with, ~ gen) cld(means_with, method = &quot;sidak&quot;, Letters = letters) ## gen emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL .group ## G17 285 84.5 54 116 455 a ## G06 315 84.5 54 145 484 ab ## G02 515 84.5 54 346 685 abc ## G12 539 84.5 54 370 708 abc ## G01 582 84.5 54 413 751 abc ## G14 583 84.5 54 414 752 abc ## G16 605 84.5 54 435 774 abcd ## G05 643 84.5 54 474 812 abcd ## G15 647 84.5 54 477 816 abcd ## G11 728 84.5 54 559 897 bcd ## G10 739 84.5 54 569 908 bcd ## G08 741 84.5 54 572 911 bcd ## G04 749 84.5 54 580 919 bcd ## G03 805 84.5 54 636 974 cd ## G09 813 84.5 54 644 982 cd ## G13 825 84.5 54 656 994 cd ## G07 937 84.5 54 768 1106 cd ## G18 1030 84.5 54 861 1199 d ## ## Confidence level used: 0.95 ## P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 18 estimates ## significance level used: alpha = 0.05 ## NOTE: If two or more means share the same grouping symbol, ## then we cannot show them to be different. ## But we also did not show them to be the same. cld(means_without, method = &quot;sidak&quot;, Letters = letters) ## gen emmean SE df lower.CL upper.CL .group ## G17 285 80 51 125 446 a ## G06 315 80 51 154 475 ab ## G02 515 80 51 355 676 abc ## G12 539 80 51 378 700 abcd ## G01 582 80 51 421 743 abcd ## G14 583 80 51 422 744 abcd ## G16 605 80 51 444 765 abcd ## G05 643 80 51 482 804 abcde ## G15 647 80 51 486 807 abcde ## G11 728 80 51 567 889 bcde ## G10 739 80 51 578 899 cde ## G08 741 80 51 581 902 cde ## G04 749 80 51 589 910 cde ## G03 805 80 51 644 966 cde ## G09 813 80 51 652 974 cde ## G13 825 80 51 664 986 cde ## G07 937 80 51 776 1098 de ## G18 1030 80 51 869 1191 e ## ## Results are averaged over the levels of: rep ## Confidence level used: 0.95 ## P value adjustment: tukey method for comparing a family of 18 estimates ## significance level used: alpha = 0.05 ## NOTE: If two or more means share the same grouping symbol, ## then we cannot show them to be different. ## But we also did not show them to be the same. 4.3.2 If you don’t include the design elements (blocks), their portion of the variance goes to the error 4.4 Tomorrow Kahoot for attendance "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
