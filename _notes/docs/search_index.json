Figure 6.1: Schematic description of an experiment with a one-way treatment structure Two-way treatment structure: a set of treatments constructed by combining the levels or possibilities of two factors. Two-way factorial treatment structure. Figure 6.2: Schematic description of an experiment with a two-way treatment structure Factorial arrangement treatment structure: a set of treatments constructed by combining the levels or possibilities of two or more different factors. Figure 6.3: Schematic description of an experiment with a three-way treatment structure Fractional factorial arrangement treatment structure: only a part, or fraction, of the possible treatment combinations in a factorial arrangement treatment structure. Figure 6.4: Schematic description of an experiment with a two-way fractional treatment structure Factorial arrangement treatment structure with one or more controls. Figure 6.5: Schematic description of an experiment with a two-way treatment structure with two controls Examples on the whiteboard 6.4 Where is the treatment structure connected to the statistical model? Remember: the general advice is to divide the sources of variation into treatment and design (i.e., topographical). Normally, the treatments affect the expected value and the experiment design has created groups of data that were generated together. Those groups are groups of similar data and that’s why we say that they are correlated. For now, we’ll leave said correlation in the residual variance-covariance matrix \\(\\mathbf{R}\\).
