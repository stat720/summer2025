Randomization happens in different domains. For example: Figure 24.1: Step 1 designing a split plot design in a CRD Figure 24.2: Step 1 designing a split plot design in a blocked structure Figure 24.3: Step 2 designing a split plot design Remember: Blocks are groups of approximately similar experimental units. Data generated by blocked designs may be analyzed as \\(y_{ij} = \\mu +\\tau_i + b_j + \\varepsilon_{ij}\\), where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the observed response for the \\(i\\)th treatment in the \\(j\\)th block, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(b_j\\) is the effect of the \\(j\\)th block, \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual of the \\(i\\)th treatment in the \\(j\\)th block. 24.2.1 Applied case: split-plot design Grain yield was measured at for a split-plot experiment of barley with fungicide treatments. Within each block, fungicides were randomized and then, barley varieties were randomly applied to smaller plots. library(tidyverse) library(agridat) library(lme4) library(DHARMa) df_splitplot &lt;- agridat::durban.splitplot m_splitplot &lt;- lmer(yield ~ fung * gen + (1|block/fung), data = df_splitplot) VarCorr(m_splitplot) ## Groups Name Std.Dev. ## fung:block (Intercept) 0.11737 ## block (Intercept) 0.16972 ## Residual 0.28119 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
