Sir R.A. Fisher did plenty of his very influential work while he was working at the Rothamsted Agricultural Station! Sir R.A. Fisher 3.4 Linear model good old friend What does “linear” mean? What does “ANOVA” mean? \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\\\ \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] OR \\[\\begin{equation} y_{i} = \\beta_0 + x_{1i}\\beta_1 +x_{2i}\\beta_2 + x_{3i}\\beta_3 + \\varepsilon_{i}, \\\\ \\varepsilon_{i} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\\\ x_{1i} = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; \\text{if treatment A}\\\\ 0, &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\\\ x_{2i} = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; \\text{if treatment B}\\\\ 0, &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\\\ x_{3i} = \\begin{cases} 1, &amp; \\text{if treatment C}\\\\ 0, &amp; \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\end{equation}\\] OR \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}, \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\sim N(\\boldsymbol{0}, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}), \\\\ \\end{equation}\\] OR \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I}), \\\\ \\boldsymbol{\\mu} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] 3.4.1 The most common assumptions behind most software Constant variance Independence Normality We can describe the general linear model as \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\varepsilon_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] where \\(y_{ij}\\) is the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(\\mu\\) is the overall mean, \\(\\tau_i\\) is the treatment effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual for the \\(j\\)th observation of the \\(i\\)th treatment (i.e., the difference between observed and predicted). The form used to describe the model above is called “Model equation form”. Another way of saying the same is the “Probability distribution form”, where we describe the distribution of \\(y\\) directly. \\[\\begin{equation} y_{ij} \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma^2), \\end{equation}\\] or \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\mu_{ij}, \\sigma^2). \\end{equation}\\] 3.5 Some Practice Check out this R script to follow along! 3.6 To do Start reading: Chapter 4 in Messy Data Vol1 (Milliken &amp; Johnson) OR Chapter 2 in GLMM (Stroup, 1st ed) - 1st edition of the GLMM book, until “Complication” Schedule a meeting to discuss your project topic.
