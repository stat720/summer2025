May 27th, 2025 Differences between observational data and data generated by controlled experiments. The role of experiment design in causal inference. The golden rules of designed experiments: Randomization Replication Local control (blocking) Experimental unit: smallest unit to which a treatment is independently assigned/applied. Observational unit: smallest unit on which observations are made. 2.1 Types of designs - the basics There are several ways to carry out an experiment. The way we carry out an experiment is important because it will establish the blueprint for how the data are generated. Figure 2.1: A blueprint is to a building what the experimental design is to the data 2.1.1 Completely randomized design (CRD) Figure 2.2: Schematic description of an experiment with a completely randomized design 2.1.2 Randomized complete block design (RCBD) Blocks are groups of similar experimental units and are large enough to fit each treatment at least once Figure 2.3: Schematic description of an experiment with a randomized complete block design 2.1.3 Incomplete block design (IBD) Blocks are groups of similar experimental units and are not large enough to fit each treatment at least once Figure 2.4: Schematic description of an experiment with a randomized complete block design "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
