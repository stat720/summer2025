Mostly applied in animal studies. More in Chapter 29 in the Messy Data book. In non-crossover designs: \\(y_{ik} = \\mu + T_i+ \\varepsilon_{ik}\\), where \\(y_{ijk}\\) is the observation for the \\(i\\)th treatment and the \\(k\\)th individual, \\(T_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\) is the residual that includes the variability between individuals (i.e., experimental units). In crossover designs, \\(y_{ijkl} = \\mu + T_i + P_j + u_k + \\varepsilon_{ijkl}\\),where \\(y_{ijk}\\) is the observation for the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(j\\)th period for the \\(k\\)th individual that recieved the treatments in the \\(l\\)th sequence, \\(T_i\\) is the effect of the \\(i\\)th treatment, \\(P_j\\) is the effect of the \\(j\\)th period, \\(u_k\\) is the (random) effect of the \\(k\\)th individual under the \\(l\\)th sequence, and \\(\\varepsilon_{ijkl}\\) is the residual. Figure 27.1: Schematic representation of a crossover design Example study the effect of \\(k\\) treatments on response \\(y\\): This study was published in Grizzle (1965). In this study, the application of treatments was performed in two periods. First, 28 persons were randomly applied 1 of 2 treatments, and the trait of study was measured at the end of the treatment duration. Then, all persons were applied the other treatment. library(lme4) library(tidyverse) df &lt;- read.csv(&quot;../data/grizzle_messydata.csv&quot;) df$Period &lt;- as.factor(df$Period) df$Person &lt;- as.factor(df$Person) m &lt;- lmer(Y ~ Trt + Period + (1|Seq:Person) , data = df) summary(m) ## Linear mixed model fit by REML [&#39;lmerMod&#39;] ## Formula: Y ~ Trt + Period + (1 | Seq:Person) ## Data: df ## ## REML criterion at convergence: 83.9 ## ## Scaled residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.7918 -0.7318 0.1402 0.6980 1.9359 ## ## Random effects: ## Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. ## Seq:Person (Intercept) 0.01502 0.1226 ## Residual 1.24534 1.1159 ## Number of obs: 28, groups: Seq:Person, 14 ## ## Fixed effects: ## Estimate Std.
