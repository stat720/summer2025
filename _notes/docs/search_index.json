Today weâ€™ll focus on those means of interest. Figure 7.1: Mindmap of the analysis of a designed experiment, from the inception to the end conclusions 7.3 ANOVA Table 7.1: Treatment ANOVA for a one-way treatment structure Source df Treatment t-1 Parallels N-t Total N-1 Table 7.2: Treatment ANOVA for a two-way treatment structure Source df Factor A a-1 Factor B b-1 A x B (a-1)(b-1) Parallels N-(ab) Total N-1 Table 7.3: Treatment ANOVA for a three-way factorial treatment structure Source df Factor A a-1 Factor B b-1 Factor C c-1 A x B (a-1)(b-1) A x C (a-1)(c-1) B x C (b-1)(c-1) A x B x C (a-1)(b-1)(c-1) Parallels N-(abc) Total N-1 7.4 Setting the stage: Estimated marginal means aka least squares means Sometimes, model coefficients or effects are hard to interpret. In designed experiments, we often use the estimated marginal means or least square means to provide a more interpretable result. Estimated marginal means are the expected mean for a given level of a factor, averaging over the other factors in the model. In R, the estimated marginal means are famously handled with the emmeans package. 7.4.1 Example: 7.4.2 Discussion What is the risk of making inference over a single treatment factor when the estimated interaction seemed to be relevant to explain variability in the data? Where do the degrees of freedom come from? 7.5 Software implementation Download the R script to follow along!
