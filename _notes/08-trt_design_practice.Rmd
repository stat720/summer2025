# Applied examples    
June 18th, 2025  

## Announcements 

- Homework due this Friday  
- Project proposal due this Friday  
- Next week will be on Zoom  
- [Your moment to ask the questions about mean estimation/multiple comparison you've always wanted to know but were too afraid to ask.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxVkuFFT4aB_LEpI_yl-SYSubvgqWJlN2fYkFHN3SUP8sOnQ/viewform?usp=dialog) [*Note: I will try to include these in class, but many might be covered in STAT 870*]
- From yesterday: ANOVA SS demo [[R script](../scripts/ss_demo.Rmd)]

```{r}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stat720/summer2025/refs/heads/main/data/blood_study_pigs.csv"
df_pigs <- read.csv(url)

## Type I 
m_intercept.only <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ 1, data = df_pigs)
m_Trt.only <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ Trt, data = df_pigs)
m_Trt.Day <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ Trt+factor(Day), data = df_pigs)
m_Trt.Day.TxD <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ Trt*factor(Day), data = df_pigs)

sum(m_intercept.only$residuals^2)
sum(m_intercept.only$residuals^2) - sum(m_Trt.only$residuals^2)
sum(m_Trt.only$residuals^2) - sum(m_Trt.Day$residuals^2)
sum(m_Trt.Day$residuals^2) - sum(m_Trt.Day.TxD$residuals^2)
sum(m_Trt.Day.TxD$residuals^2)

anova(m_Trt.Day.TxD)

## Type II 

m_intercept.only <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ 1, data = df_pigs)
m_Day.only <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ factor(Day), data = df_pigs)
m_Trt.only <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ Trt , data = df_pigs)
m_Trt.Day <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ Trt + factor(Day), data = df_pigs)
m_Trt.Day.TxD <- lm(Serum_haptoglobin_mg.dL ~ Trt*factor(Day), data = df_pigs)

sum(m_intercept.only$residuals^2)
sum(m_Day.only$residuals^2) - sum(m_Trt.Day$residuals^2)
sum(m_Trt.only$residuals^2) - sum(m_Trt.Day$residuals^2)
sum(m_Trt.Day$residuals^2) - sum(m_Trt.Day.TxD$residuals^2)
sum(m_Trt.Day.TxD$residuals^2)
