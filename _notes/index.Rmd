- About you:    

### Logistics  

- [Website](https://stat720.github.io/summer2025)
- Syllabus
- Statistical programming requirements  
- Rough draft of the course  
- Semester project - design your own experiment.   
- Grades: A (100-89.999999999(!!!)), B (89.99-79.99), C (79.99-69.99), D (69.99-59.99), F (<59.99).


## Learning goals   

By the end of this course, you should be able to:  
- Be able to identify the treatment design and experiment design (and other components of the design).  
- Be able to write out the statistical model.  
- Know the benefits/disadvantages of different experiment designs.  

## Notes on notation  

- scalars: $y$, $\sigma$, $\beta_0$  
- vectors: $\mathbf{y} \equiv [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]'$, $\boldsymbol{\beta} \equiv [\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_p]'$, $\boldsymbol{u}$  
- matrices: $\mathbf{X}$, $\Sigma$  
- probability distribution: $\mathbf{y} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I})$     

## Why do designed experiments exist?  

### Example  

Your friend Susie is planting tomatos in her backyard. She bought three different varieties and wishes to know which one she likes the best, to buy more next year. The traits Susie values the most are yield (in kg week^-1^) and size (in g tomato^-1^).  

Which scenario do you think is more appropriate?  

**Case A:**   
Susie buys 3 plants of each variety. She divides her orchard into three sectors and plants each variety in a different sector.  

**Case B:**   
Susie buys 1 plant of each variety. She divides her orchard into three sectors and plants each variety in a different sector.  

**Case C:**   
Susie buys 3 plants of each variety. She randomly assigns what variety goes into which hole.  


## The golden rules of designed experiments  

- Randomization  
- Replication  
- Local control
