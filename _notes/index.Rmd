## About this course:  

### Logistics  

- [Website](https://stat720.github.io/summer2025)
- Syllabus
- Statistical programming requirements  
- Rough draft of the course  
- Semester project - design your own experiment.   
- Grades: A (100-89.999999999(!!!)), B (89.99-79.99), C (79.99-69.99), D (69.99-59.99), F (<59.99).

### Philosophy  

#### Statistics  

- Statistical thinking. How are the data generated?  
- Writing out statistical models
- Fitting the model using R  

#### Teaching  
- Applied problems  
- Kahoot  

## Learning goals   

By the end of this course, you should be able to:  
- Be able to identify the treatment design and experiment design (and other components of the design).  
- Be able to write out the statistical model.  
- Know the benefits/disadvantages of different experiment designs.  

## Why do we design experiments?
