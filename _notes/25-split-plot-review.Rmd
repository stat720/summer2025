## Split plot designs  

- Blocks are groups of approximately similar experimental units. 
- Data generated by blocked designs may be analyzed as $y_{ij} = \mu +\tau_i + b_j + \varepsilon_{ij}$, where $y_{ij}$ is the observed response for the $i$th treatment in the $j$th block, $\tau_i$ is the effect of the $i$th treatment, $b_j$ is the effect of the $j$th block, $\varepsilon_{ij}$ is the residual of the $i$th treatment in the $j$th block.
